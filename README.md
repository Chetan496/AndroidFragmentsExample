### Fragments - reusable UI blocks in Android - a demonstration

This repository contains some code which demonstrates the basic usage of Android Fragments.
Android Fragments are reusable UI blocks - you can use them in multiple activities conditionally.

You can also decide to show a fragment based on the device screen/resolution or other criteria.
An example - you can choose to show more data on a tablet, but less data on a mobile screen.
