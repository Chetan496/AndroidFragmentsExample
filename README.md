### Fragments - resuable UI blocks in Android - a demonstration

This reposiroty contains some code which demonstartes the basic usage of Android Fragments.
Android Fragments are resuable UI blocks - you can use them in multiple activities conditionally.

You can also decide to show a fragment based on the device screen/resolution or other criteria.
An example - you can choose to show more data on a tablet, but less data on a mobile screen.
